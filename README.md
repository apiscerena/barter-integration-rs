# Barter-Integration
A high-performance Web integration library for streaming public data from leading cryptocurrency
exchanges - batteries included. Part of the [`Barter`] ecosystem. It is:
* **Normalised**: Barter-Data's unified interface for consuming public WebSocket data means every Exchange returns a normalised data model.
* **Real-Time**: Barter-Data utilises real-time WebSocket integrations enabling the consumption of normalised tick-by-tick data.
* **Easy**: Barter-Data's simple ExchangeClient interface allows for easy & quick setup.
* **Extensible**: Barter-Data is highly extensible, and therefore easy to contribute to via new integrations!

**Note: Barter-Integration is recommended for use with [`Barter-Data`] & [`Barter`].**

## Overview
Barter-Data is a high-performance WebSocket integration library for streaming public data from leading cryptocurrency
exchanges. It presents an easy to use, extensible, interface that can deliver normalised exchange data in real-time.
At a high level, it provides a few major components:
* ConnectionHandler that manages the WebSocket connection (ping-pongs, re-connections, rate-limiting) and actions subscription
  requests on behalf of an Exchange Client implementation (eg/ Binance Exchange Client).
* Unified ExchangeClient trait that enables easy extensibility, ease of use, and the delivery of a normalised data model
  to downstream consumers.

## Example
Binance tick-by-tick Trade consumer with Barter-Data.

```rust,no_run
use barter_data::client::binance::Binance;
use barter_data::client::ClientConfig;
use barter_data::ExchangeClient;
use tokio_stream::StreamExt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialise new Binance Exchange Client
    let mut binance = Binance::init().await?;
    
    // Subscribe & consume normalised Trade stream
    let mut trade_stream = binance
        .consume_trades(String::from("btcusdt"))
        .await?;
    
    // Loop over arriving Trades
    while let Some(trade) = trade_stream.next().await {
        // Do something with normalised Trade
        println!("{:?}", trade);
    }
}
```
